    "Let's build an Advanced RAG with a GraphRAG agent that will run a combination of Llama 3.1 and GPT4o, for Llama 3.1 we will use Ollama. The idea is that we use GPT4o for advanced tasks, like generating the Neo4j query and Llama3.1 for the rest. \n",

    "We'll combine ideas from three RAG papers into a RAG agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Routing:**  Adaptive RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14403)). Route questions to different retrieval approaches\n",
    "- **Fallback:** Corrective RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.15884.pdf)). Fallback to web search if docs are not relevant to query\n",
    "- **Self-correction:** Self-RAG ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11511)). Fix answers w/ hallucinations or don’t address question\n",

    "Note that this will incorperate [a few general ideas for agents](https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reflection**: The self-correction mechanism is a form of reflection, where the LangGraph agent reflects on its retrieval and generations\n",
    "- **Planning**: The control flow laid out in the graph is a form of planning \n",
    "- **Tool use**: Specific nodes in the control flow (e.g., web search) will use tools\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Prompt design and engineering has rapidly become essential for maximizing the\\npotential of large language models. In this paper, we introduce core concepts,\\nadvanced techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Reflection, and the principles\\nbehind building LLM-based agents. Finally, we provide a survey of tools for\\nprompt engineers.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Two ways has been discussed to unlock the reasoning capability of a large\\nlanguage model. The first one is prompt engineering and the second one is to\\ncombine the multiple inferences of large language models, or the multi-agent\\ndiscussion.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The final frontier for simulation is the accurate representation of complex,\\nreal-world social systems. While agent-based modeling (ABM) seeks to study the\\nbehavior and interactions of agents within a larger system, it is unable to\\nfaithfully capture the full complexity of human-driven behavior.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: In this past year, large language models (LLMs) have had remarkable success\\nin domains outside the traditional natural language processing, and people are\\nstarting to explore the usage of LLMs in more general and close to application\\ndomains like code generation, travel planning, and robot controls.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Traditional base station siting (BSS) methods rely heavily on drive testing\\nand user feedback, which are laborious and require extensive expertise in\\ncommunication, networking, and optimization.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Instruction-following agents must ground language into their observation and\\naction spaces. Learning to ground language is challenging, typically requiring\\ndomain-specific engineering or large quantities of human interaction data.

HELPER sets a new state-of-the-art in the TEACh\\nbenchmark in both Execution from Dialog History (EDH) and Trajectory from\\nDialogue (TfD), with a 1.7x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for\\nTfD.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Pre-trained and frozen large language models (LLMs) can effectively map\\nsimple scene rearrangement instructions to programs over a robot's visuomotor\\nfunctions through appropriate few-shot example prompting. To parse open-domain\\nnatural language and adapt to a user's idiosyncratic procedures, not known\\nduring prompt engineering time, fixed prompts fall short. In this paper, we\\nintroduce HELPER, an embodied agent equipped with an external memory of\\nlanguage-program pairs that parses free-form human-robot dialogue into action\\nprograms through retrieval-augmented LLM prompting: relevant memories are\\nretrieved based on the current dialogue, instruction, correction, or VLM\\ndescription, and used as in-context prompt examples for LLM querying. The\\nmemory is expanded during deployment to include pairs of user's language and\\naction plans, to assist future inferences and personalize them to the user's\\nlanguage and routines. HELPER sets a new state-of-the-art in the TEACh\\nbenchmark in both Execution from Dialog History (EDH) and Trajectory from\\nDialogue (TfD), with a 1.7x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art for\\nTfD.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Highly effective, task-specific prompts are often heavily engineered by\\nexperts to integrate detailed instructions and domain insights based on a deep\\nunderstanding of both instincts of large language models (LLMs) and the\\nintricacies of the target task.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI across diverse domains,\\nshowcasing remarkable capabilities.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: This technical report presents the Drama Engine, a novel framework for\\nagentic interaction with large language models designed for narrative purposes.\\nThe framework adapts multi-agent system principles to create dynamic,\\ncontext-aware companions that can develop over time and interact with users and\\neach other.

The framework adapts multi-agent system principles to create dynamic, context-aware companions that can develop over time and interact with users and each other. Key features include multi-agent workflows with delegation, dynamic prompt assembly, and model-agnostic design. The Drama Engine introduces unique elements such as companion development, mood systems, and automatic context summarising. It is implemented in TypeScript. The framework's applications include multi-agent chats and virtual co-workers for creative writing. The paper discusses the system's architecture, prompt assembly process, delegation mechanisms, and moderation techniques, as well as potential ethical considerations and future extensions.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Prompt engineering is a technique that involves augmenting a large\\npre-trained model with task-specific hints, known as prompts, to adapt the\\nmodel to new tasks. Prompts can be created manually as natural language\\ninstructions or generated automatically as either natural language instructions\\nor vector representations. Prompt engineering enables the ability to perform\\npredictions based solely on prompts without updating model parameters, and the\\neasier application of large pre-trained models in real-world tasks. In past\\nyears, Prompt engineering has been well-studied in natural language processing.\\nRecently, it has also been intensively studied in vision-language modeling.\\nHowever, there is currently a lack of a systematic overview of prompt\\nengineering on pre-trained vision-language models. This paper aims to provide a\\ncomprehensive survey of cutting-edge research in prompt engineering on three\\ntypes of vision-language models: multimodal-to-text generation models (e.g.\\nFlamingo), image-text matching models (e.g. CLIP), and text-to-image generation\\nmodels (e.g. Stable Diffusion). For each type of model, a brief model summary,\\nprompting methods, prompting-based applications, and the corresponding\\nresponsibility and integrity issues are summarized and discussed. Furthermore,\\nthe commonalities and differences between prompting on vision-language models,\\nlanguage models, and vision models are also discussed. The challenges, future\\ndirections, and research opportunities are summarized to foster future research\\non this topic.\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Prompt optimization aims to find the best prompt to a large language model\\n(LLM) for a given task.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT in\\nvarious fields emphasizes the importance of ``prompt engineering,'' a\\ntechnology to improve the quality of model outputs. With companies investing\\nsignificantly in expert prompt engineers and educational resources rising to\\nmeet market demand, designing high-quality prompts has become an intriguing\\nchallenge. In this paper, we propose a novel attack against LLMs, named prompt\\nstealing attacks. Our proposed prompt stealing attack aims to steal these\\nwell-designed prompts based on the generated answers. The prompt stealing\\nattack contains two primary modules: the parameter extractor and the prompt\\nreconstruction. The goal of the parameter extractor is to figure out the\\nproperties of the original prompts. We first observe that most prompts fall\\ninto one of three categories: direct prompt, role-based prompt, and in-context\\nprompt. Our parameter extractor first tries to distinguish the type of prompts\\nbased on the generated answers. Then, it can further predict which role or how\\nmany contexts are used based on the types of prompts. Following the parameter\\nextractor, the prompt reconstructor can be used to reconstruct the original\\nprompts based on the generated answers and the extracted features. The final\\ngoal of the prompt reconstructor is to generate the reversed prompts, which are\\nsimilar to the original prompts. Our experimental results show the remarkable\\nperformance of our proposed attacks. Our proposed attacks add a new dimension\\nto the study of prompt engineering and call for more attention to the security\\nissues on LLMs.\"\n",

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as\\nautonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text\\nprompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Guidance,\\nNavigation, and Control in space, enabling LLMs to have a significant role in\\nthe decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first\\nstep towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the\\nKerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software\\ndesign competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering\\nsatellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP\\ngame engine.

      "    \"System: # Knowledge Graph Instructions for GPT-4\\n## 1. Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: The rise of capabilities expressed by large language models has been quickly\\nfollowed by the integration of the same complex systems into application level\\nlogic.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Interaction with Large Language Models (LLMs) is primarily carried out via\\nprompting.

A prompt is a natural language instruction designed to elicit certain behaviour or output from a model. In theory, natural language prompts enable non-experts to interact with and leverage LLMs. However, for complex tasks and tasks with specific requirements, prompt design is not trivial. Creating effective prompts requires skill and knowledge, as well as significant iteration in order to determine model behavior, and guide the model to accomplish a particular goal. We hypothesize that the way in which users iterate on their prompts can provide insight into how they think prompting and models work, as well as the kinds of support needed for more efficient prompt engineering. To better understand prompt engineering practices, we analyzed sessions of prompt editing behavior, categorizing the parts of prompts users iterated on and the types of changes they made. We discuss design implications and future directions based on these prompt engineering practices.\"\n",

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations.

Overview\\nYou are a top-tier algorithm designed for extracting information in structured formats to build a knowledge graph.\\nTry to capture as much information from the text as possible without sacrificing accuracy. Do not add any information that is not explicitly mentioned in the text.\\n- **Nodes** represent entities and concepts.\\n- The aim is to achieve simplicity and clarity in the knowledge graph, making it\\naccessible for a vast audience.\\n## 2. Labeling Nodes\\n- **Consistency**: Ensure you use available types for node labels.\\nEnsure you use basic or elementary types for node labels.\\n- For example, when you identify an entity representing a person, always label it as **'person'**. Avoid using more specific terms like 'mathematician' or 'scientist'.- **Node IDs**: Never utilize integers as node IDs. Node IDs should be names or human-readable identifiers found in the text.\\n- **Relationships** represent connections between entities or concepts.\\nEnsure consistency and generality in relationship types when constructing knowledge graphs. Instead of using specific and momentary types such as 'BECAME_PROFESSOR', use more general and timeless relationship types like 'PROFESSOR'. Make sure to use general and timeless relationship types!\\n## 3. Coreference Resolution\\n- **Maintain Entity Consistency**: When extracting entities, it's vital to ensure consistency.\\nIf an entity, such as \\\"John Doe\\\", is mentioned multiple times in the text but is referred to by different names or pronouns (e.g., \\\"Joe\\\", \\\"he\\\"),always use the most complete identifier for that entity throughout the knowledge graph. In this example, use \\\"John Doe\\\" as the entity ID.\\nRemember, the knowledge graph should be coherent and easily understandable, so maintaining consistency in entity references is crucial.\\n## 4. Strict Compliance\\nAdhere to the rules strictly. Non-compliance will result in termination.\\nHuman: Tip: Make sure to answer in the correct format and do not include any explanations. Use the given format to extract information from the following input: Recent efforts to enable visual navigation using large language models have\\nmainly focused on developing complex prompt systems. These systems incorporate\\ninstructions, observations, and history into massive text prompts, which are\\nthen combined with pre-trained large language models to facilitate visual\\nnavigation.

Creating effective prompts requires skill and knowledge, as well as significant iteration in order to determine model behavior, and guide the model to accomplish a particular goal. We hypothesize that the way in which users iterate on their prompts can provide insight into how they think prompting and models work, as well as the kinds of support needed for more efficient prompt engineering.

In particular, we discover that applying different reasoning paths for different roles is an effective strategy to implement few-shot prompting approaches in the multi-agent scenarios.

      "      \"Summary\": \"In this work, we aim to push the upper bound of the reasoning capability of LLMs by proposing a collaborative multi-agent, multi-reasoning-path (CoMM) prompting framework. Specifically, we prompt LLMs to play different roles in a problem-solving team, and encourage different role-play agents to collaboratively solve the target task. In particular, we discover that applying different reasoning paths for different roles is an effective strategy to implement few-shot prompting approaches in the multi-agent scenarios. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods on two college-level science problems over competitive baselines. Our further analysis shows the necessity of prompting LLMs to play different roles or experts independently.\",\n",
