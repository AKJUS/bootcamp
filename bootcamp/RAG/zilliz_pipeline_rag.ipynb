This method is easier to integrate into your RAG application.\n"

This function maps an input field (doc_url) to four output fields (doc_name, chunk_id, chunk_text, and embedding) as the scalar and vector fields of the auto-generated collection. The field names cannot be changed.\n",
    "- The `PRESERVE` function stores user-defined input fields as additional scalar fields in the auto-generated collection for storing metadata. You can use PRESERVE functions to preserve the metadata of your documents. A single PRESERVE function preserves one field, and up to five PRESERVE functions can be added to one Ingestion pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will create an INDEX_DOC function and a PRESERVE function. They will eventually create a collection in the cluster, named `my_rag_collection`. It contains five fields:\n",

You can create collections in the cluster and insert entities into them. In comparison to a relational database, a collection in a cluster is similar to a table in the database, and an entity in a collection is similar to a record in the table.\\nCluster\\nWhen creating a cluster on Zilliz Cloud, you must specify the type of CU associated with the cluster. There are three types of CUs available: performance-optimized, capacity-optimized, and cost-optimized. You can learn how to choose among these types in Select the Right CU.\\nAfter determining the CU type, you must also specify its size. Note that the number of collections a cluster can hold varies based on its CU size. A cluster with less than 8 CUs can hold no more than 32 collections, while a cluster with more than 8 CUs can hold as many as 256 collections.\\nAll collections in a cluster share the CUs associated with the cluster. To save CUs, you can unload some collections. When a collection is unloaded, its data is moved to disk storage and its CUs are freed up for use by other collections. You can load the collection back into memory when you need to query it. Keep in mind that loading a collection requires some time, so you should only do so when necessary.\\nCollection',\n '64-bit integer (INT64)\\nVariable character (VARCHAR)\\nJSON\\nZilliz Cloud provides three types of CUs, each of which have its own application scenarios, and they are also the factor that impacts search performance.\\n📘 Notes\\nFLOAT_VECTOR is the only data type that supports vector embeddings in Zilliz Cloud clusters.\\nIndex\\nUnlike Milvus instances, Zilliz Cloud clusters only support the AUTOINDEX algorithm for indexing. This algorithm is optimized for the three types of computing units (CUs) supported by Zilliz Cloud. For more information, see AUTOINDEX Explained.\\nEntities\\nEntities in a collection are data records sharing the same set of fields, like a book in a library or a gene in a genome. As to an entity, the data stored in each field forms the entity.\\nBy specifying a query vector, search metrics, and optional filtering conditions, you can conduct vector searches among the entities in a collection. For example, if you search with the keyword \"Interesting Python demo\", any article whose title implies such semantic meaning will be returned as a relevant result. During this process, the search is actually conducted on the vector field title_vector to retrieve the top K nearest results. For details on vector searches, see Search and Query.']"
