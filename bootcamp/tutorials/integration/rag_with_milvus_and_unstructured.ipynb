Most contributors are experts from the high-performance computing (HPC) community, specializing in building large-scale systems and optimizing hardware-aware code.

      "Unstructured data, such as text, images, and audio, varies in format and carries rich underlying semantics, making it challenging to analyze. To manage this complexity, embeddings are used to convert unstructured data into numerical vectors that capture its essential characteristics. These vectors are then stored in a vector database, enabling fast and scalable searches and analytics.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Milvus offers robust data modeling capabilities, enabling you to organize your unstructured or multi-modal data into structured collections. It supports a wide range of data types for different attribute modeling, including common numerical and character types, various vector types, arrays, sets, and JSON, saving you from the effort of maintaining multiple database systems.\n",

      "Milvus offers three deployment modes, covering a wide range of data scales—from local prototyping in Jupyter Notebooks to massive Kubernetes clusters managing tens of billions of vectors:\n",

      "\n",
      "Milvus was designed from day one to be a highly efficient vector database system. In most cases, Milvus outperforms other vector databases by 2-5x (see the VectorDBBench results). This high performance is the result of several key design decisions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Hardware-aware Optimization: To accommodate Milvus in various hardware environments, we have optimized its performance specifically for many hardware architectures and platforms, including AVX512, SIMD, GPUs, and NVMe SSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Advanced Search Algorithms: Milvus supports a wide range of in-memory and on-disk indexing/search algorithms, including IVF, HNSW, DiskANN, and more, all of which have been deeply optimized. Compared to popular implementations like FAISS and HNSWLib, Milvus delivers 30%-70% better performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Search Engine in C++: Over 80% of a vector database's performance is determined by its search engine. Milvus uses C++ for this critical component due to the language's high performance, low-level optimization, and efficient resource management. Most importantly, Milvus integrates numerous hardware-aware code optimizations, ranging from assembly-level vectorization to multi-thread parallelization and scheduling, to fully leverage hardware capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "Column-Oriented: Milvus is a column-oriented vector database system. The primary advantages come from the data access patterns. When performing queries, a column-oriented database reads only the specific fields involved in the query, rather than entire rows, which greatly reduces the amount of data accessed. Additionally, operations on column-based data can be easily vectorized, allowing for operations to be applied in the entire columns at once, further enhancing performance.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",

In addition, Milvus components are well decoupled, with the three most critical tasks—search, data insertion, and indexing/compaction—designed as easily parallelized processes, with complex logic separated out. This ensures that the corresponding query node, data node, and index node can scale both up and out independently, optimizing performance and cost efficiency.\n",
