What do the parameters for HNSW mean?,"* M: maximum degree, or number of connections a node can have in the graph.  It affects the trade-off between search quality and memory consumption.
* efConstruction: number of nearest neighbors to consider when constructing nodes in a graph.
* ef: number of nearest neighbors to consider when searching for closest vectors in a graph layer. Higher values of either efConstruction or ef can improve recall rate at the cost of increased build or search time.
","In order to improve performance, HNSW limits the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph to M. In addition, you can use efConstruction (when building index) or ef (when searching targets) to 'specify a search range. HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) is a graph-based indexing algorithm. It builds a multi-layer navigation structure for an image according to certain rules. In this structure, the upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther; the lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer. The search starts from the uppermost layer, finds the node closest to the target in this layer, and then enters the next layer to begin another search.

These parameters help control the structure and behavior of the multi-layer navigation graph in HNSW.","In Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing algorithm, there are several key parameters that control its behavior.  Here's a brief explanation of some important ones:  * `M`: The maximum degree of nodes on each layer. This limits the number of edges connecting to any node. * `efConstruction` and `efSearch`: These specify the efficiency factor for building (construction) or searching targets in an index. A higher value means more efficient construction/search, but may also lead to a less accurate result.  These parameters can be adjusted depending on your specific use case and requirements. For example, you might want to increase `M` if you have many nodes with few connections each, while decreasing it could help when working with denser graphs.","The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  * M: the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph, which limits the number of nodes that can be connected to each node. * efConstruction: the search range when building the index, which controls the number of nodes to consider during the construction process. * ef: the search range when searching targets, which controls the number of nodes to consider during the search process.  These parameters can be adjusted to improve the performance of the HNSW algorithm.","The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  * M: The maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph, which is used to limit the number of neighbors considered during search. * efConstruction and ef: These parameters control the search range when building an index or searching targets. They specify how many approximate nearest neighbors to consider.  These parameters can be adjusted to improve performance by balancing between precision and recall in the search results.",The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  * M: The maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph. * efConstruction: The efficiency parameter for building the index. * ef: The efficiency parameter for searching targets.  These parameters can be adjusted to improve the performance of the HNSW algorithm.,"The parameters for HNSW include the maximum degree of nodes on each layer (M), and the search range specified by efConstruction (when building index) or ef (when searching targets), which is also known as the “searching factor"". M is used to limit the number of neighboring nodes to be searched, in order to improve performance. The ef parameter determines the number of candidates to be searched in the process of index building or target searching. A higher ef value can result in a more accurate search but will take longer to complete.

What does nlist vs nprobe mean in ivf_flat?,"# nlist:  controls how the vector data is partitioned into clusters during indexing.  # nprobe:  how many of those clusters are searched during a query. Set nlist to around 4 * sqrt(n), where n is the total number of vectors. nprobe requires tuning to balance accuracy and performance based on the dataset characteristics.","IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters.","By adjusting nprobe, an ideal balance between accuracy and speed can be found for a given scenario. Results from the IVF_FLAT performance test demonstrate that query time increases sharply as both the number of target input vectors (nq), and the number of clusters to search (nprobe), increase.  IVF_FLAT is the most basic IVF index, and the encoded data stored in each unit is consistent with the original data.","""nlist"" refers to the number of cluster units or partitions into which data is divided. ""nprobe"" indicates the number of these clusters that are queried during a search. Essentially, nlist determines how finely data is partitioned, while nprobe controls how many partitions are searched to find approximate nearest neighbors.","`nlist` and `nprobe` are two distinct parameters that control the trade-off between search speed and recall.  **`nlist`**: This parameter controls the number of cluster units (also called ""centroids"" or ""codewords"") used to represent the index. Think of it as the granularity of the clustering. A higher value for `nlist` means more clusters, which can improve search recall but increase indexing time and memory usage.  **`nprobe`**: This parameter controls the number of units (or centroids) to query during search. It determines how many ""closest"" cluster centers to consider when searching for nearest neighbors. A higher value for `nprobe` means more probes, which can improve search accuracy at the expense of increased computation time and memory usage.  To summarize:  * `nlist` controls the number of clusters (index units) in the index. * `nprobe` controls the number of cluster centers to query during search.  For example, if you set `nlist=128` and `nprobe=8`, the index will use 128 clusters to represent the data, and during search, it will consider 8 closest cluster centers to find the nearest neighbors.","`nlist` and `nprobe` are two distinct parameters.  `nlist` refers to the number of cluster units or the number of centroids in the index.

What is the default AUTOINDEX index and vector field distance metric in Milvus?,Trick answer:  Index=HNSW and vector field distance metric=IP inner product. Not yet updated in documentation still says L2.,"Index parameters dictate how Milvus organizes your data within a collection. You can tailor the indexing process for specific fields by adjusting their metric_type and index_type. For the vector field, you have the flexibility to select COSINE, L2, or IP as the metric_type. For the vector field, you can use AUTOINDEX as the index type and use COSINE, L2, or IP as the metric_type.  For scalar fields, including the primary field, Milvus uses TRIE for integers and STL_SORT for strings.  For additional insights into index types, refer to Index notes","IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters.
