What do the parameters for HNSW mean?,"# M: maximum degree, or number of connections a node can have in the graph.  It affects the trade-off between search quality and memory consumption.
# efConstruction: number of nearest neighbors to consider when constructing nodes in a graph.
# ef: number of nearest neighbors to consider when searching for closest vectors in a graph layer. Higher values of either efConstruction or ef can improve recall rate at the cost of increased build or search time.
",https://milvus.io/docs/index.md,"HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) is a graph-based indexing algorithm. It builds a multi-layer navigation structure for an image according to certain rules. In this structure, the upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther; the lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer. The search starts from the uppermost layer, finds the node closest to the target in this layer, and then enters the next layer to begin another search.  In order to improve performance, HNSW limits the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph to M. In addition, you can use efConstruction (when building index) or ef (when searching targets) to specify a search range.

It builds a multi-layer navigation structure for an image according to certain rules. In this structure, the upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther; the lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer.","The parameters for HNSW are as follows:
- M: Maximum degree of the node, limiting connections on each layer of the graph. Range is [2, 2048].
- efConstruction: Parameter used during index building to specify a search range and improve recall rate.
- ef: Parameter used when searching targets to specify a search range and potentially increasing search time.
These parameters help optimize the performance of the HNSW algorithm by controlling connectivity and search behavior within the multi-layer navigation structure.","The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  * `M`: Maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph. It ranges from 2 to 2048.  These parameters can be used during index construction (`efConstruction`) or search (`ef`) to specify a search range and improve performance.  In simpler terms, these parameters control how densely connected the graph is at each level, allowing you to balance recall rate (how many relevant results are found) against search time.","The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  1. M: This is the maximum degree of the nodes in the graph. It controls the 'sparsity of the upper layers and the density of the lower layers. The range for M is (2, 2048).  2. efConstruction: This parameter specifies the search range when building the index. It affects the recall rate and search time - a higher value can improve recall at the cost of increased search time.  3. ef: This parameter specifies the search range when searching for targets. Similar to efConstruction, a higher value can improve recall but increase search time.","The parameter M in HNSW represents the maximum degree of a node, or in other words, the maximum number of connections a node can have. This parameter can have a value between 2 and 2048. The parameters efConstruction and ef are used to specify the search range during index building and target searching, respectively.

What does nlist vs nprobe mean in ivf_flat?,"# nlist:  controls how the vector data is partitioned into clusters during indexing.  # nprobe:  how many of those clusters are searched during a query. Set nlist to around 4 * sqrt(n), where n is the total number of vectors. nprobe requires tuning to balance accuracy and performance based on the dataset characteristics.
",https://milvus.io/docs/index.md,"FAQ  What is the difference between FLAT index and IVF_FLAT index? GPU_IVF_FLAT  Similar to IVF_FLAT, GPU_IVF_FLAT also divides vector data into nlist cluster units, and then compares distances between the target input vector and the center of each cluster. Depending on the number of clusters the system is set to query (nprobe), similarity search results are returned based on comparisons between the target input and the vectors in the most similar cluster(s) only – drastically reducing query time.","index? IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike IVF_FLAT, FLAT directly compares the distances between the target vector and each and every vector. Therefore, when the total number","In IVF_FLAT, nlist refers to the number of clusters that the vector data is divided into for efficient similarity search. The higher the value of nlist, the more clusters there are and potentially more accurate results can be obtained during a query operation.

The default value for nlist is 16384, which means the vector space is divided into 16384 clusters.

The number of clusters to query for similarity search results is determined by the parameter nprobe.
In GPU_IVF_FLAT index, similar to IVF_FLAT, the distance between the target input vector and the center of each cluster is compared to find the most similar clusters to the target input. This reduces query time by only querying the vectors in the most similar cluster(s) to the target input. The recommended default value for nlist in GPU_IVF_FLAT indexing is 128, depending on the size of the dataset and the resources available on the GPU.
