What do the parameters for HNSW mean?,"# M: maximum degree of nodes in a layer of the graph. 
# efConstruction: number of nearest neighbors to consider when connecting nodes in the graph.
# ef: number of nearest neighbors to consider when searching for similar vectors.
",https://milvus.io/docs/index.md,"this value can improve recall rate at the cost of increased search time. HNSW HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) is a graph-based indexing algorithm. It builds a multi-layer navigation structure for an image according to certain rules. In this structure, the upper layers are more sparse and the distances between nodes are farther; the lower layers are denser and the distances between nodes are closer. The search starts from the uppermost layer, finds the node closest to the target in this layer, and then enters the next layer to begin another search. After multiple iterations, it can quickly approach the target position. In order to improve performance, HNSW limits the maximum degree of nodes on each layer of the graph to M. In addition, you can use efConstruction (when building index) or ef (when searching targets) to specify a search range. Index building parameters Parameter Description Range M Maximum degree of the node (2, 2048)","The parameters for HNSW are as follows:\n
# M: Maximum degree of the node, limiting the connections each node can have in the graph. Range is [2, 2048].\n
# efConstruction: Parameter used during index building to specify a search range.\n
# ef: Parameter used when searching for targets to specify a search range.\n","The parameters for HNSW include M, which is the maximum degree ofnnodes on each layer of the graph, and ef (construction) or ef (search), which are used to specify a search range. These parameters can be adjusted to improve performance.","The parameters for HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) are:  1. M: This is the maximum degree of the nodes in the graph. It controls the 'sparsity of the upper layers and the density of the lower layers. The range for M is (2, 2048).  2. efConstruction: This parameter specifies the search range when building the index. It affects the recall rate and search time - a higher value can improve recall at the cost of increased search time.  3. ef: This parameter specifies the search range when searching for targets. Similar to efConstruction, a higher value can improve recall but increase search time.

What does nlist mean in ivf_flat?,The `nlist` parameter in IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into `nlist` clusters. ,https://milvus.io/docs/index.md,"index? IVF_FLAT index divides a vector space into nlist clusters. If you keep the default value of nlist as 16384, Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the centers of all 16384 clusters to get nprobe nearest clusters. Then Milvus compares the distances between the target vector and the vectors in the selected clusters to get the nearest vectors. Unlike IVF_FLAT, FLAT directly compares the distances between the target vector and each and every vector. Therefore, when the total number","In IVF_FLAT, nlist refers to the number of cluster units that divide a vector space.
