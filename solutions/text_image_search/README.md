# Text Image Search

Retrieval is the task of finding the most relevant object in a database given a query. In text-image search, we helps you search for matched or related images given an input text.

This text-image search example mainly consists of one notebook, and I think everyone can learn the basic operations of Towhee and Milvus through the [**notebook**](./1_build_text_image_search_engine.ipynb). 

## Learn from Notebook


In [this notebook](./1_build_text_image_search_engine.ipynb) you will get the prerequisites, how to complete a simple text-image search and visualize results,and show you how to start the FastAPI service.
If you want to learn how to improve the system performance and stability, you can refer [this link](https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/blob/main/image/text_image_search/2_deep_dive_text_image_search.ipynb)
