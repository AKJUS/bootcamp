# Molecular Search

Drug discovery, as the source of medical innovation, is an important part of new medicine research and development. Drug discovery is implemented by target selection and confirmation. In order to discover available compounds in the fragment space from billion-scale compound libraries, chemical fingerprint is usually retrieved for substructure search and similarity search.



This bootcamp will show you how to find the similar, sub or super molecular formula. It mainly consists of one notebook, I think everyone can learn the basic operations of Molecular Search System through the [**getting started notebook**](./1_build_molecular_search_engine.ipynb).

## Learn from Notebook

In [this notebook](./1_build_molecular_search_engine.ipynb) you will get the prerequisites, how to complete a simple molecular search system and visualize the results. 
If you want to learn how to improve system stability, you can refer [this link](https://github.com/towhee-io/examples/blob/main/medical/molecular_search/2_deep_dive_molecular_search.ipynb)
