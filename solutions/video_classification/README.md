# Video Tagging

Video tagging means adding proper tags for videos. Tags can be various from different aspects. For example, object detection, action recognition, place identification can all contribute to video tagging.

This video tagging bootcamp mainly includes one notebook for each type of tagging. You can learn about video tagging solutions from these notebook tutorials.

- [Video Tagging](./1_video_classification.ipynb)

In this notebook you will build a basic video tagging system with sample data (of 20 human activities), visualize predicted labels, and measure the system with performance metrics. Moreover, you can try optimization methods for accuracy and efficiency. At the end, you are able to build up a playable video tagging system with 5 lines of code.
